**Business Problem:** A 2002 survey conducted in the USA by the IRC (Insurance Research Council) indicates that 1340 bodily injury liability claims were made from a single state.

This was done to understand the characteristics of the claimants who choose to be represented by an attorney when settling a claim.

The profits of the insurance firm were found to be dependent on whether the claimant appoints an attorney or not. Thus the appointment of an attorney can often increase the amount the claimant can claim from the firm.

Thus this insurance firm is interested in finding what are the chances a claimant would appoint an attorney.

Depending on the demographic characteristics of the claimants who appoint an attorney, the firm aims to design different policy instruments for different target groups.
